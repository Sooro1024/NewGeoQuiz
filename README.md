# NewGeoQuiz

I am pleased to report that in the Corrected branch. You can see the corrected code with using of React hooks.
/*Attention. The application is now fully working. But there are some flaws in the code. I will correct them in the shortest possible time. I want to use React Hooks and in accordance with React philosophy in particular, where it says 'There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application'.I would like to make some small changes.*/

Project description:  Our project is a little game- geography quiz about countries and their capitals and flags. The game has three levels of difficulty and the ability to play for a time. It is a ReactJS project. In the work we used resources from Material UI library. We received the necessary dates using HTTP requests. CSS was used to define the style and design of our document.
